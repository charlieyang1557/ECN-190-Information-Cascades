# Information Cascades

## Abstract
This project investigates the phenomenon of "information cascades" through an experiment where participants are provided private information regarding an urn color. Participants make sequential predictions, with access to their private signal and prior participants’ public predictions, and receive a payoff. If public decisions match, successive participants should follow the pattern regardless of their private information, creating “information cascades.” The second part of this report discusses further experimentation on participants’ risk aversion, manipulated through payoff amounts.

## Introduction
The experiment tests whether participants rely and trust public predictions of other participants over their own private information. Information Cascades affect rational decision making and allow economists to analyze herding behavior. This experiment is particularly useful for analyzing investment patterns, marketing, and voting implications.

## Procedure
The experiment involved thirty-six participants divided into six groups, each consisting of six subjects. The participants were provided with two urns. The blue urn had two blue balls and one red ball. The red urn had two red balls and one blue ball. The participants were ordered sequentially, and each participant could see what players before them predicted and make their own prediction regarding which urn the ball came from. Once the round ends, the correct answer is given. Participants are given an initial endowment of $6.00. Those who predicted correctly received a $2.00 payoff, while those who guessed incorrectly received a $0.50 payoff.

## Prediction
We hypothesized that if the first two participants' predictions match, the third participant will use prior participant’s predictions to make a decision, disregarding their private information. This should create a chain of decision making that encourages a false sense of certainty, all driven by the first two predictions.

## Analysis
In total, we ran our experiment over the course of 15 minutes for all five participating groups. In 25 rounds of our experiment, 11 cascades formed (44%). We categorized participant decisions using the following: in orange, participants made random choices prior to other player’s public predictions, deviating from their own private information. In green, participants deviated from the information cascade, following prior predictions or private information. In yellow, participants formed an information cascade.

## Novel Experiment
A novel, tangential experiment we will explore is the effect of loss aversion on information cascades. Specifically, how will player behavior change in the information cascade, given a larger penalty for loss? Loss aversion can be defined as the people’s tendency to avoid losses more than equivalent gains.

## Conclusion
Participants can be influenced by other participants' decisions. However, their influence is fragile. If we were to re-run our novel experiment with the ECN 190 class, the data on page two would likely look different. Since college students tend to live on a tight budget, their aversion to losses of $2.00 should be significant. As mentioned above, we expect to see more students creating information cascades in earlier rounds. However, they should also consider their private information to prevent a major loss.
